I only forked https://github.com/jhannah/sandbox because I am interested in https://github.com/daveloyall/sandbox/tree/master/ne.gov, and I don't see a github option for some sort of "sparse fork"... :)

ne.gov/go.pl is a tool that generates graphviz maps of the relationship between PHINMS service/action pairs and database tables (or web service endpoints) for a given PHINMS installation.  It accomplishes this by directly reading some of your PHINMS config files (.xml).  This is a work in progress.
