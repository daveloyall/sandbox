Hi! My name is Jay. I've been coding since 1995. 

I hang out on IRC all the time. I like helping people. But I've very busy. Mostly
with computer stuff. :)   If you want my help, here's how to get it. 

Firstly, **do not paste into IRC**. Use a code sharing service like [no paste](http://paste.scsys.co.uk) or [gist](http://gist.github.com).

No paste **all three** of these things **every time**:

(1) Your current source code. e.g.:

```
use 5.12.1;
say "Hello, world!";
```

Yes, show me everything. If your question is on line 80, say so. If your program is huge then
make a small demo program that recreates the part you're struggling with. Programming is mostly 
about reducing massively complex things into tiny, trivial things. 

(2) You running your program, all output, and the next prompt. e.g.:

```
$ perl myprog.pl
Hello, world!
$
```

Yes, show me everything. I can sift through too much information far faster than I can 
explain to you what I need and why.  If you assume "this is the only bit you need" you're 
probably just slowing us down, wasting your time and mine.

(3) Your current question. **ONE** question. What were you expecting? What did you get instead?
You may have a dozen problems all at once, but you need to start at one question and we'll go
from there. One step at a time. 

By fully framing one clear question you've got a good chance of realizing the answer yourself. 
If not, you've greatly helped me (or anyone else!) help you. 

Thanks! See you online! :)
